An existing soft-deleted Backup Protected VM exists with the source VM %q in the recovery services
vault %q, however automatically recovering this Backup Protected VM has been disabled via the 
"features" block.

Terraform can automatically recover the soft-deleted Backup Protected VM when this behaviour is
enabled within the "features" block (located within the "provider" block) - more
information can be found here:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/features-block

Alternatively you can manually recover this (e.g. using the Azure CLI) and then import
this into Terraform via "terraform import".
