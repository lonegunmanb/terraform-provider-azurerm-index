An existing soft-deleted Key Vault exists with the Name %q in the location %q, however
automatically recovering this KeyVault has been disabled via the "features" block.

Terraform can automatically recover the soft-deleted Key Vault when this behaviour is
enabled within the "features" block (located within the "provider" block) - more
information can be found here:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/features-block

Alternatively you can manually recover this (e.g. using the Azure CLI) and then import
this into Terraform via "terraform import", or pick a different name/location.
