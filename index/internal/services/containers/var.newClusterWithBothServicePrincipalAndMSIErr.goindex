var newClusterWithBothServicePrincipalAndMSIErr = fmt.Errorf(`
Azure Kubernetes Service has recently made several breaking changes to Cluster Authentication as
the Managed Identity Preview has concluded and entered General Availability.

During the Preview it was possible to create a Kubernetes Cluster using Mixed Mode Authentication,
meaning that you could specify both a Service Principal and a Managed Identity. Now that this has
entered General Availability, Managed Identity is used for all cluster related authentication.

This means that it's no longer possible to create a Mixed-Mode cluster - as such the 'identity'
and 'service_principal' block cannot be specified together. Instead you can either use a Service
Principal or Managed Identity for Cluster Authentication - but not both.

In order to create this Kubernetes Cluster, please remove either the 'identity' block or the
'service_principal' block.
